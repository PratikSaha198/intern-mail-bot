Publication : Dynamic source routing in ad hoc wireless networks 
URL : https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-0-585-29603-6_5
Summary : This paper presents a protocol for routing in ad hoc networks that uses dynamic source routing. The protocol adapts quickly to routing changes when host movement is frequent, yet requires little or no overhead during periods in which hosts move less frequently. The protocol performs well over a variety of environmental conditions, such as host density and movement rates.

Publication : Initial sequencing and comparative analysis of the mouse genome 
URL : https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/publications/initial-sequencing-and-comparative-analysis-of-the-mouse-genome
Summary : This paper reports the results of an international collaboration to produce a high-quality draft sequence of the mouse genome. It also presents an initial comparative analysis of the mouse and human genomes. The sequence of the mouse genome is a key informational tool for understanding the contents of the human genome and a key experimental tool for biomedical research.

Publication : Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science 
URL : https://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716.abstract
Summary : Even research of exemplary quality may have irreproducible empirical findings because of random or systematic error. There is concern about the rate and predictors of reproducibility, but limited evidence. Direct replication is the attempt to recreate the conditions believed sufficient for obtaining a previously observed finding with new data. A large-scale, collaborative effort was conducted to obtain an...
